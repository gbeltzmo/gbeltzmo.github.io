# Teaching


### Smith College
* SDS 271: Programming for Data Science in Python (Fall 2025)
  * This course covers the skills and tools needed to process, analyze and visualize data in Python and work on collaborative projects. Topics include functional and object oriented programming in Python, data wrangling in Pandas, visualization in Matplotlib in seaborn, as well as creating a reproducible workflow: debugging, testing and documenting programs, and effectively using version control. The major goal for the course is to create a viable, open-source Python package like those in the Python Package Index (PyPI).

* SDS 291: Multiple Regression (Fall 2025)
  * Theory and applications of regression techniques: linear and nonlinear multiple regression models, residual and influence analysis, correlation, covariance analysis, indicator variables and time series analysis. This course includes methods for choosing, fitting, evaluating and comparing statistical models and analyzes data sets taken from the natural, physical and social sciences.
