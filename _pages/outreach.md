I have been participating in various science outreach activities since I started college in 2012. Not only do I find it fun and rewarding to share my love of science with people, but I also think outreach is vitally important for making science accessible to the public and for building a more diverse and inclusive STEM community.

Here are a few of the outreach activities I have enjoyed over the years:
* Science Careers in Search of Women Event at Argonne National Laboratory (March 2023)
  * Panelist on a Women in STEM panel
* Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics at Argonne National Laboratory (January 2023)
  * Led a python workshop; participated in Q&A sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities with students  
* AAS Congressional Visits Day (virtual) (September 2020)
  * Scheduled meetings with my state representatives and spoke with them to advocate for the importance of funding scientific research
* Science Day with Nashville Girl Scouts (March 2019)
  * Built bottle rockets and explained my job as an astronomer 
* Meet the Astronomer Night at Dyer Observatory (October 2018)
  * Gave a public talk about the standard model of cosmology, how we model galaxy clustering, and what galaxy clustering can tell us about the nature of dark matter and dark energy
* Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science (Fall 2016)
  * Visited middle school classes throughout the semester to teach a variety of chemistry and physics lessons and give fun science demonstrations
* Whitin Observatory Volunteer, Wellesley College (Fall 2012 - Spring 2016)
  * Organized, advertised, and led public nights several times per semester; gave observatory tours, telescope demonstrations, and public talks to guests of all ages
