I thoroughly enjoy performing public outreach, and have been participating in various science outreach activities since I started college in 2012. Not only do I find it fun and rewarding to share my love of science with people, but I also think outreach is vitally important for making science accessible to the public and for building a more diverse and inclusive STEM community.

Here are a few of the outreach activities I have enjoyed over the years:
* AAS Congressional Visits Day (virtual) (September 2020)
  * On behalf of the American Astronomical soceity, I scheduled meetings with my state representatives and spoke with them to advocate for the importance of funding scientific research.
* Science Day with Nashville Girl Scouts (March 2019)
  * I spent the morning teaching the girls to build bottle rockets, and then spent the afternoon explaining what it's like to be an astronomer and answering questions about my career and astronomy in general.
* Meet the Astronomer Night at Dyer Observatory (October 2018)
  * I gave a public talk about the standard model of cosmology, how we model galaxy clustering, and what galaxy clustering can tell us about the nature of dark matter and dark energy. 
* Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science (Fall 2016)
  * As a volunteer for VSVS I visited middle school classes throughout the semester to teach a variety of chemistry and physics lessons and give fun science demonstrations.
* Whitin Observatory Volunteer, Wellesley College (Fall 2012 - Spring 2016)
  * As a volunteer, I helped organize, advertise, and lead public nights several times per semester. At these public nights, I gave observatory tours, telescope demonstrations, and frequently gave public talks to guests of all ages.
